# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. Given the highly imbalanced dataset, our goal is to improve fraud detection accuracy while minimizing false positives.

## Problem Statement
Fraudulent transactions pose a significant challenge to financial institutions, leading to economic losses and security risks. The key challenge is to accurately classify fraudulent transactions from legitimate ones, given the dataset's class imbalance.

## Data Source
- **Dataset:** [Kaggle - Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud/data)
- **Total Transactions:** 284,807
- **Fraud Cases:** 492 (highly imbalanced dataset)
- **Features:** 31 columns (Time, Amount, and 28 anonymized PCA features)

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handled missing values and standardized the dataset.
   - Applied feature engineering techniques to improve model performance.

2. **Dimensionality Reduction:**
   - Applied **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to reduce feature dimensionality.
   - Applied **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)** for better class separation.

3. **Classification Models:**
   - **Na√Øve Bayes**
   - **Logistic Regression**
   - **Support Vector Machines (SVMs)**
   - Evaluated performance using metrics like Precision, Recall, and F1-score.

4. **Confidence Analysis:**
   - Assessed classification confidence levels.
   - Visualized fraud detection results.
